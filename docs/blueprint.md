- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF) - a subtle and calming tone for extended screen time.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) provides a gentle contrast to the sky blue.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', sans-serif, for a contemporary, precise feel. Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for readability and warmth. 
- Use modern, clear icons related to school activities (graduation cap, books, calculator) throughout the app.
- Emphasize clean, grid-based layouts with ample whitespace to enhance clarity and reduce clutter.
